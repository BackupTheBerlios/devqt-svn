<h1>Releasing a new version</h1>
<p>
	Releasing a new version is not something that shuold be done without carefull thinking.
	This document will describe how to release a new version for DevQt.
</p>

<h1>Basic development plan</h1>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>	
			Our goal is to move from developing unstable
			software, to maintaining stable versions, and developing new versions. 
		</li>
		<li>
			All versions until V 1.0 are considered <b>unstable</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			All the development is done in SVN trunk.
		</li>
		<li>
			We will only maintain one stable version, and a development trunk. Until we reach
			V 1.0 there will be no stable version nor branch.
		</li>
		<li>
			When we release V 1.0, a new branch called DEVQT_1_0_X will be opened. All the commits
			to this branch will be done only to fix existing bugs. When enough bugs will be closed 
			(or an urgent release will be needed) the code will tagged as DEVQT_1_0_1 and released 
			as version 1.0.1.<br>
			On the other hand, all the development will be done on the trunk, and may be released
			as a V 1.1.X. <br>
			When the code on the trunk will be stable enough, the team will decide to make a feature freeze 
			and no new features will be added. As on the stable branchs, the trunk will only have commits
			for fixing bugs. When the code will be stable enough, it will be released as V 1.2.0, and a new 
			stable branch will be opened DEVQT_1_2_X. <br>
			Again, trunk contain the development branch 1.3.x, to become 1.4.0. The branch 1.2.x will only
			have commits to fix bugs.<br>
			... and so on...
		</li>
		<li>
			When the team releases a new stable version (from trunk, not an update) the team will
			decide to do a mini feature freeze, in which no new features will be added, and only bug
			fixes will be done.<br>
			Note that until we reach V 1.0, all releases are "unstable" and will have the same mini features
			freeze.
		</li>
		<li>
			A week before any release (from the unstable branch or the stable), the SVN will be in complete 
			freeze. A release source will be made, and the release source will be tested under several platforms
			by all the developers. If the code compiles and works (and not blocking bugs have been found in the
			test time) the zip will be released as is. Otherwise, a commit will be done to the SVN and a new zip 
			file will be created. If needed, more time will be added to the test time.
		</li>
	</ol>

</p>

<h1>Taks to do before a release</h1>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Create a release souce, and upload it to the tmp dir on the web server.
			This zip file will be tested and if no blocking bugs have been found, we will continue
			to the next phase.
		</li>
		<li>
			Screen shots will be made of the new version, if possible under several operating systems.
			The screen shots will be added to the screen shots folder on the web, and to the berlios
			managment system.
		</li>
		<li>
			The new version of the web site will be uploaded to the <b>SVN</b>, and if the team
			agrees on the modifications made to the site, the site will be uploaded (only after the files
			have been uploaded to berlios managment system).
		</li>
		<li>
			If after a week of testing, no bugs have been found, and the team agrees on the new text 
			for the web site, a new release will be defined the berlios managment system, and the web page
			will be uploaded from the SVN to the real site.
		</li>

	</ol>
