    <h1>The small story to begin with</h1>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a cool C++ toolkit for developing cross-platform applications called Qt.
      But there was no cross-platform IDE suitable for creating cross-platform applications with it.
      "That is unfair!", thought young brave developer FullMetalCoder and initiated one. His child name
      was DevQt...
      <br/>
      Time passed. DevQt has been growing up. Developers liked it. Some joined to help FullMetalCoder
      raising his child. But each of them had his own opinion about the way DevQt should behave. So he
      did his best to implement this or that feature. This was a road to nowhere...
      <br/>
      Now the time has come to make everything organized! The time has come to make separated developers
      to start acting as a team!
    </p>

    <h1>Being responsible</h1>
    <p>
      For the first sight it seems participating in an Open Source project bares no responsibilities.
      You could join some project "just for fun". But in case if you joined it for the others benefit
      you should think about it once again.
      <br/>
      If something goes wrong there's nobody to blame for it, because nobody's responsible for it.
      On the other hand, if the project is successful who's success is it? Nobody's! Because nobody is
      responsible for it.
    </p>

    <h1>Site management</h1>
    <p>
      Nowadays having a site for project is a must. There's no need to convince anybody.
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>monitoring the progress</li>
        <li>posting news</li>
        <li>making announcements and polls</li>
        <li>updating online documentation</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> elcuco
    </p>

    <h1>GUI, look-and-feel, artwork</h1>
    <p>
      DevQt is a tool with graphical user interface, so it should be convenient and pleasant to use it.
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>creating standards-aware UI</li>
        <li>taking care of artwork such as icons, logo and other eye-candies</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> volunteers needed
    </p>

    <h1>Localization</h1>
    <p>
      Any modern piece of software should be able to &quot;speak&quot; to user his own language.
      DevQt is not an exception.
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>keeping DevQt translation-aware</li>
        <li>involving translators</li>
        <li>monitoring translators' work</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> Cesar
    </p>

    <h1>Deployment</h1>
    <p>
      Prebuilt binary packages help to save time compiling DevQt from sources and solving problems
      with integration into existing system. These packages also help those, who just started
      their programmer career and are unfamiliar with all the command-line compiling stuff.
      Needless to say this piece of work is important too.
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      Depend on chosen deployment packages.
      <br/>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> Cesar, volunteers needed
    </p>

    <h1>Managing patches</h1>
    <p>
      One of the benefits of Open Source is that anybody can participate. There're different ways of
      doing so. One of them is sending patches and bug-fixes.
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>keeping track of patch submissions</li>
        <li>reviewing submissions</li>
        <li>committing or rejecting straightforwards patches</li>
        <li>assigning patches to other coders according to their responsibilities</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> elcuco, volunteers needed
    </p>

    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p>
      Providing documentation is a good practice.
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>documenting features</li>
        <li>integrating Qt documentation</li>
        <li>making context help available</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> volunteers needed
    </p>

    <h1>Plugins</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Divide et impera!</em>
      <br/>
      Splitting application into independent modules gives lots of advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>ease of maintenance</li>
        <li>ease of concurrent development</li>
        <li>extensibility</li>
        <li>linear complexity growth</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>designing robust plugin interface</li>
        <li>implementing plugin-related mechanics</li>
        <li>managing third-party plugin contributions</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> volunteers needed
    </p>

    <h1>Qt toolkit integration</h1>
    <p>
      Qt comes with a bunch of useful and well-done set of tools. It would be weird if DevQt
      would ignore this fact and provide no integration with them.
      <br/>
      <strong>Tasks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>making use of Qt formats (i.e. documentation format)</li>
        <li>implementing integration with Qt tools (Designer, Assistant, Linguist, qmake and others)</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Responsible:</strong> Cesar, volunteers needed
