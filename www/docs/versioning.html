  <h1>Instead of prologue</h1>
  <p>
    DevQt team are not young girls and boys in a sandbox anymore, playing developer games, proudly releasing
    new versions of not yet ready, buggy software, called DevQt. That's why it is suggested to
    choose the versioning scheme and decide how to make sure the next version is ready for release.
  </p>

  <h1>Assigning version numbers</h1>
  <p>
    As DevQt is tightly bound to Qt itself, so adopting Qt's versioning scheme looks reasonable. <br/>
    This way each version will look like DevQt-X.Y.Z, where
    <ul>
      <li><strong>X</strong> &mdash; <em>MAJOR version number</em></li>
      <li><strong>Y</strong> &mdash; <em>MINOR version number</em></li>
      <li><strong>Z</strong> &mdash; <em>patch level</em></li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Releasing new version</h1>
  <p>
    DevQt exists for less then a month, but even now it has some unresolved bugs registered on
    <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=6155">BerliOS bugtraq</a>. Then why are
    those new versions still released?
    To solve this issue a brand-new version creation cycle suggested:
    <ol>
      <li>Defining TODO list for new version.</li>
      <li>Implementing the TODO list. No new bells and whistles should be added except those,
        noted in current TODO list.</li>
      <li>Team testing. Fixing bugs. <em>Increase patch level, to see version number progress :)</em></li>
      <li>Announcing new version on QtCentre. Testing by QtCentre inhabitants. Fixing bugs.
        <em>Increase patch level, to see version number progress :)</em></li>
      <li>Put some new screenshots on
        <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/screenshots/?group_id=6155">BerliOS screenshot page</a>.</li>
      <li>Build ready to use packages and put them on BerliOS download section.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h1>Deploying DevQt as ready to use packages</h1>
  <p>
    The target audience of DevQt is developer community. As a developer one should be able to compile it himself,
    but speed up getting started with DevQt for those, who cannot/doesn't want to do this for some reason,
    maintaining prebuilt packages might be handy.
    <br/>
  </p>

  <h1>Suggested packages list</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Linux</strong>
    <p>
      Linux comes in a wide variety of distributions, so we might provide...
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Static binary package.</strong> For those, who haven't got Qt 4.1.x installed.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared binary package.</strong> For those, who have :)</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution specific packages:</strong> <br/>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Debian package</strong></li>
            <li><strong>RPM package</strong> Different RPM's for SuSE, Fedora, Mandrake and others...</li>
            <li><strong>Gentoo ebuild</strong> <em>Being a proud Gentoo user, Cesar should cope with this ;)</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <strong>FreeBSD</strong>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DevQt Ports entry</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <strong>Win32</strong>
    <p>
      Windows is a special case, we might use some sort of installer, maybe <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">NSIS</a>.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Static package installer</strong> For those, who haven't got Qt 4.1.x installed.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared package installer</strong> For those, who have.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <strong>Mac</strong>
    <p>
      Any ideas appreciated!
    </p>

    <em><strong>Note:</strong> all these packages aren't a must, but just suggestions.</em>
