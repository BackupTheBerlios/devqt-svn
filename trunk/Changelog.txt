 23 February 2006 : Official beta 2
	- implemented the Damn Best Project Parser Ever!!! It took me a whole WE and now handles everything:
		* scopes : all syntaxes (single line, multiline, mixed) and nested
		* folders (which are nothing but special scopes)
		* variables : all operators and nested (using "$$")
	- added a splash nice screen
	- added support for translations (only a minimalistic french one is provided but feel free to add others!)
	- added project saving
	- added two buttons in the status bar for hidding/showing dock wigets
	- added help menu
		* about Qt
		* Qt Assistant
		* about DevQt (TODO...)
		* Help on DevQt (may wait a very long time...)
	- started settings use :
		* added "reopen" action : 5 most recent projects and 15 most recents files (out of project)
		* added a basic (non working) customization dialog
	- find & replace dialogs aren't modals anymore (also removed stay on top hint)
	- corner widget split in two part, modified icons and size of the toolbuttons.
	- fixed toolbar size, should now fit in every resolution
	- fixed a few highlighting bugs
	- fixed a parser bug : space(s) after the last operand of an assignement operator added an empty string
	- modified parser behaviour at variable level for more flexibility (each operator has its own QStringList)
	- plastique isn't used as default style anymore (except under Win32 whose native style is definitely ugly!)
	- changed a few icons
	- improved action enabling/disabling depending to openned file or projects


 16 February 2006 : first open release that features kind of a roadmap
	- find & replace dialogs use the damn useful stay on top (Thanks a lot to Cesar)
	- added a corner widget for the tabwidget, 2 buttons :
		* '+' creates anew empty editor
		* '-' deletes the current active editor (close it actually)
	- NEW (nowhere else!!!) : editor widget handles the insert key
	- DevStatus moved inside DevGUI, now holds 6 labels, each having a different display purpose :
		* number of lines in the widget
		* position of the mouse cursor
		* position of the text cursor (damn elcuco! you got it! Happy??? :P )
		* Insert/Overwrite mode
		* state of the QTextDocument (modified or not)
		* general purpose, left for standard messages 
		(please do not try to use the QStatusBar::message(const QString&) function :
		it wouldn't display the given text but may disturb the display of labels)
	- fixed undo/redo : for an unknown and weird reason, breakpoints and errors broke it
	- fixed 2 highlighting bug reported by DAMN! I CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME...
	- fixed an unreported highlighting bug : comments directly preceded by letters or numbers weren't highlighted
	- fixed icon size troubles
	- improved project files (.pro) handling
	- improved save mechanism (prompt at close, save only if modified...)

 Known bugs :
	- when editing inside a multiline string, typing '\' freezes the program.
	I think it comes from highlighting but don't manage to solve it!


 So long ago : first version released
	- lots of TODOs ;)
