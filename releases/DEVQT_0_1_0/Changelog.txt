 16 February 2006 : first open release that features kind of a roadmap
	- find & replace dialogs aren't modals anymore (Thanks a lot to Cesar)
	- added a corner widget for the tabwidget, 2 buttons :
		* '+' creates anew empty editor
		* '-' deletes the current active editor (close it actually)
	- NEW (nowhere else!!!) : editor widget handles the insert key
	- DevStatus moved inside DevGUI, now holds 6 labels, each having a different display purpose :
		* number of lines in the widget
		* position of the mouse cursor
		* position of the text cursor (damn elcuco! you got it! Happy??? :P )
		* Insert/Overwrite mode
		* state of the QTextDocument (modified or not)
		* general purpose, left for standard messages 
		(please do not try to use the QStatusBar::message(const QString&) function :
		it wouldn't display the given text but may disturb the display of labels)
	- fixed undo/redo : for an unknown and weird reason, breakpoints and errors broke it
	- fixed 2 highlighting bug reported by DAMN! I CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME...
	- fixed an unreported highlighting bug :
	comments directly preceded by letters or numbers were not highlighted
	- fixed icon size troubles
	- improved project files (.pro) handling
	- improved save mechanism (prompt at close, save only if modified...)

 Known bugs :
	- when editing inside a multiline string, typing '\' freezes the program.
	I think it comes from highlighting but don't manage to solve it!

 TODO:
	- add "save project" option
	- implement the properties dialog
	- implement compilation ( still a lot of work to do!!! )
	- add a dialog that deals with text editor properties and GUI style (singleton)
	- and a lot more... :)


 So long ago : first version released
	- lots of TODOs ;)
